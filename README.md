**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on web pages. It provides the structural foundation for web content, such as text, images, and links, through the use of tags and elements.
**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the layout, presentation, and visual appearance of HTML elements on a web page. It allows defining the color, typography, spacing, and other visual aspects to enhance the aesthetics and usability of a website.
